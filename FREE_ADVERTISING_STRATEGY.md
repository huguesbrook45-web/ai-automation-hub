Tweet 1:
Most solopreneurs waste 10+ hours/week on repetitive tasks.

I built a free ROI calculator that shows exactly how much time 
you could save with automation.

Try it: [your-url]/calculator

It takes 2 minutes and might change your business.

---

Tweet 2:
The best automation tool isn't the fanciest one.

It's the one you'll actually use.

I see people buy expensive tools and never set them up. 
Start with free tools (n8n, Zapier free tier) and master 
ONE workflow first.

Then scale.

---

Tweet 3:
Automated my email responses yesterday.

Saved 5 hours this week alone.

The setup took 30 minutes. The ROI is insane.

If you're interested in how, I wrote a detailed guide: [your-url]/guides
```

### Twitter Growth Strategy

- **Post daily** (1-2 tweets per day)
- **Engage with others** (reply to 5-10 tweets daily)
- **Share threads** (1-2 per week)
- **Use relevant hashtags** (#automation #solopreneur #nocode)
- **Build relationships** with automation/business accounts

---

## 4. LinkedIn (Professional Network)

LinkedIn reaches business owners and professionals looking to improve efficiency.

### LinkedIn Content Strategy

**Post Types:**
1. **Insights & Lessons** - Share what you've learned
2. **Case Studies** - Show real results
3. **Industry Trends** - Comment on automation trends
4. **Personal Stories** - Build connection and authority
5. **Helpful Resources** - Share guides and tools

### Sample LinkedIn Posts

```
Post 1:
I spent 3 years building automation workflows for clients.

Here's what I learned:

1. Most people overestimate what they can automate in 1 month
   but underestimate what they can do in 1 year

2. The best automation is the one that's actually implemented
   (not the most complex one)

3. Email workflows save the most time for solopreneurs
   (average: 8-12 hours/week)

4. ROI becomes positive within 30 days for most automations

5. The hardest part isn't the setup—it's knowing where to start

I built a free ROI calculator to help people figure out their 
starting point: [your-url]/calculator

What's the biggest bottleneck in your business?

---

Post 2:
Just helped a client save 15 hours/week with automation.

Here's what we automated:
- Email responses (4 hours/week)
- Customer onboarding (6 hours/week)
- Invoice generation (3 hours/week)
- Data entry (2 hours/week)

Total setup time: 8 hours
Monthly savings: 60 hours
ROI: 7.5x in first month

The tools? Free and low-cost options only.

If you're curious about what's possible for your business, 
I wrote a detailed guide: [your-url]/guides

What would you automate first?
```

### LinkedIn Strategy
